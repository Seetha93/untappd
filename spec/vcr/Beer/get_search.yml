        Day One, we''ve been abundantly forthright and fully transparent about our

        intense for their time and all timeless in their intensity. For Stone Go To
        IPA, we are embracing our hop obsession in a new way, funneling an abundance
        of lupulin-borne bitterness into a \"session\" IPA delivering all the fruity,
        piney character of a much bigger IPA. To accomplish this, we employed \"hop
        bursting,\" a new technique wherein an irrational amount of hops is added
        during the final phase of the brewing process to coax out extreme flavors
        and aromas while also imparting a burst of desirably pleasant bitterness.
        The result is an Alpha-acid-rich beer that fans can enjoy more of without
        missing out on the assertive hop character you, like us, crave. So, sit back
        and go two with your new everyday go-to IPA and bask along with us in the

        please think of this as a celebration of Matt. We do. We can\u2019t contemplate

        He was exuberant, courageous, outwardly positive, and the type of stalwart
        friend everybody who knew him was happy to have in their corner. Matt\u2019s
        smile and voluminous laugh were infectious mainstays around the brewery. He
        was larger than life in every way...and he was without a doubt an incredible
        brewer.\n\nEveryone at Stone recognized Matt\u2019s prowess and passion for
        brewing. He loved to explore what-ifs and why-nots. He crafted the beer you
        hold in your hands, which he conceived with Stone friend and colleague, Brian
        Bishop. Burning Rosids is a Belgian-style saison incorporating a unique ingredient-cherrywood
        smoked malt (the name references the rosid plant family from which cherry
        trees hail).\n\nBrian and Matt\u2019s many devoting brewing comrades here
        at Stone were proud to hoist this mash paddles and brew this recipe for him
        as a symbolic gesture of how much he meant to everyone and how immensely he
        is missed. When you enjoy this very special beer, please join all of us in

        Kyle Hollingsworth:\nHere we go! It''s a new year in brews. I''ve got a feeling
        it''s going to be a good beer year.\n\nI started 2014 in San Diego with my
        friends at Stone Brewing Company. We''re making a nationally-released beer
        for the spring. This is a collaboration between Stone, Keri Kelli and me -
        guitarist for Alice Cooper and beer connoisseur from LA.\n\nIt''s a wild mixture
        on many levels. Keri and I are pretty far apart in our music worlds, but it
        makes for great \"mashup\" of hard rock and funk. The beer will definitely
        go to 11! With an ABV of 9.8% and coriander, elderberries it''s as unusual
        as our musical backgrounds. Look for that at special events in April and everywhere
        soon after.\n\nMore immediately, I''m working with SKA Brewing Company for
        a one-off brew. This is for my upcoming 2014 BrewSki tour in Colorado. I''m
        excited to get out and play yet another fun weekend with music, brews, and
        snow. With \"Kyle''s Manipulated Modus IPA,\" we added more hops (if you can
        believe that), an additional dry hop of Mandarina Bavaria and an orange peel
        in a whirlpool. I haven''t tasted it yet, looking forward to the enhanced
        flavor profiles.\n\nThere are lots of new brews in the works for 2014. I''m
        getting ready to release a new solo disc in August and plan to have a beer
        come out with each single. I''m calling it \"Hop tracks.\" Stay tuned for
        more info on these brews.","created_at":"Mon, 17 Mar 2014 21:23:53 +0000","beer_style":"Imperial

        to our participation in at least a half a dozen collaborations each year,
        one might perceive Stone as the craft beer equivalent of a beer flitting indiscriminately
        from one brewery to the next, all the while drawing precious nectar- the expertise
        and creativity of those institutions\u2019 brewmasters.\n\nAnother buzzy operation
        that gets the same rap is Bluejacket, a new Washington DC-based operation
        headed by industry veteran and constant collaborator, Megan O\u2019Leary Parisi.
        But make no mistake, Stone and Bluejacket are intensely selective about the
        contemporaries we invite into our brewhouses. We look for the same high level
        of passion and daringness to flip a beer style on its head that we employ
        on a daily basis. So, when Parisi and Stone brewmaster, Mitch Steele, decided
        to collaborate, it was essential that they tap a special individual to complete
        theyr triad of fermentation domination, and they found just that in Tonya
        Cornett, the brewmaster at Bend, Oregon\u2019s 10 Barrel Brewing Company.\n\nTogether,
        they decided on a sturdy yet velvety base of imperial porter and developed
        a plan to celebrate the bounty of the environs in which it was produced by
        harvesting avocado honey, jasmine and calendula flowers (some from our very
        own Stone Farms) and infusing them into the beer to create something complex
        and uniquely Southern Californian. Consider it craft cross-pollination at
        its finest.","created_at":"Sat, 31 Aug 2013 18:12:32 +0000","beer_style":"Imperial

        but as we strive to do with all our Stone Anniversary Ales of the let''s-take-this-IPA-in-a-new-direction
        variety, we''ve brewed up a Stone-worthy divergence from tradition. The amount
        of rye malt we used isn''t quite enough to warrant the appellation \"Rye IPA,\"
        but it still adds hints of spiciness that contrast deliciously with the tropical
        fruit flavors and aromas of the Amarillo and Calypso hops. Add a few European
        specialty malts, some lemon verbena, and three more hop varieties to the mix,
        and you have a highly complex brew melding both bitter and fruity hop notes
        with rich toasted malt character punctuated by nuances of spicy rye and subtle
        lemon.\n\nAppearance:\nBeautiful light amber with a thick creamy tan head
        of foam.\nAroma:\nAn incredible blend of fruits: citrus, lemon, and peaches,
        with hints of mint and dry-roasted nutty malt flavors.\nTaste:\nA very clean
        maltiness, intense peachy\/mango Amarillo hops, hints of apples and berries,
        finishing in a burst of fresh lemon, hop bitterness, and herbal spiciness.\nPalate:\nSmooth
        and complex malt flavors, medium body, the very slightest hint of alcohol
        heat, with a refreshingly bitter and citrusy finish.\nOverall:\nFrom the first
        time I smelled a broken leaf from a lemon verbena bush at Stone Farms, I thought
        its intense lemony character would be a great addition to an IPA. It truly
        is \"more lemon than lemon.\" The lemon flavors combine wonderfully with the
        peach and tropical mango flavors from the Amarillo, and the apple and berry
        notes from the Calypso hops. The result is an intense, bitter and very refreshing
        take on a double IPA. Perfect for a Southern California summer.","created_at":"Mon,
